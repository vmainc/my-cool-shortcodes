== Frequently Asked Questions ==

To create a new shortcode, navigate to the 'Shortcodes' settings page in your WordPress admin menu and click on 'Add Shortcode'. Fill out the required fields and save your shortcode.

= Can I edit an existing shortcode? =

Yes! On the 'Shortcodes' settings page, you'll see a list of all your existing shortcodes. Simply click 'Edit' next to the shortcode you want to modify, make your changes, and save.

= How do I delete a shortcode? =
